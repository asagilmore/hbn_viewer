# Tractoscope Local Server

This python script will create a local server that serves GET request
and a special request type "listFiles" which returns a json containing
the files in a given folder.

## Usage

To run the project, use the following command, optionally specifing the port:

```bash
python host.py --port 8000
```

## You can also use the docker image to run the server

To give the image access to you dataset run the docker container
with the -v argument, linking a folder named datasets, containing your
datasets on your local machine to one inside the container.

replace 'externalPort' with whatever port you would
like to bind the server to

```bash
docker run -v /path/to/datasets:/app/datasets -p 'externalPort':8000 tractoscope-local-server
```
