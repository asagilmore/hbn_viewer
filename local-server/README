# Tractoscope Local Server

This python script will create a local server that serves GET request
and a special request type "listFiles" which returns a json containing
the files in a given folder.

## Usage

To run the project, use the following command, optionally specifing the port:

```bash
python host.py --port 8000
```

## You can also use the docker image to run the server

To give the image access to you dataset run the following command

replace 'externalPort' with whatever port you would
like to bind the server to

```bash
docker run -v /path/to/dataset:/datasets -p 'externalPort':8000 tractoscope-local-server
```
